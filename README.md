# Ruins-of-Caelid
Unreal Engine | Dungeon Explorer Prototype

Ruins of Caelid is a third-person dungeon exploration prototype built in Unreal Engine 5. Developed during university as a solo project, the game focuses on atmospheric exploration, basic combat systems, and environmental storytelling. While unfinished, it demonstrates my work in level design, Unreal Blueprints, and player-system interaction.

## Overview
This prototype includes:
- First-person movement and camera control
- Early level layout and lighting design

The goal was to prototype a dark, decayed dungeon environment with Soulslike inspiration and focus on exploration-first design.
